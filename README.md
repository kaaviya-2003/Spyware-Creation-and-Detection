# Spyware-Creation-and-Detection
Modern information systems are highly intricate and comprise numerous subsystems, networks, and operating systems that are vulnerable to exploitation by 
attackers on a regular basis. This project delves into the topic of spyware, examining its behaviour, usage, and recent attacks. 
Through developing a Python-based spyware program, we demonstrate common features of such software. Given the increasing threat posed byspyware, ranging from state-sponsored espionage to simpler data scams and financial hacking, studying this issue is crucial.
In this project we used Python to implement various features of the spyware including IP Logger, Webcam
Capture, Wi-Fi Password Stealer, Screen Capture, Audio Capture Key & Mouse Capture and detected
spyware using different machine learning algorithms
